<summary><b>ðŸ’» Why I didn't code in 2023?</b></summary>
  
1. <h5>From class 10<sup>th</sup> to 12<sup>th</sup> I was just doing coding all day, learning new tech, which lead to 81%ile (50/300) in JEE Mains 2023 (not qualified for JEE ADV).</h5>
2. <h5>On April 2023 I decided to take a drop and prepare again, I didn't touched my laptop for that year and got into IIT BHU with 97.3%ile (190/300) in JEE Mains.</h5>
